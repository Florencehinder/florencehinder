### It's me, Flo! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an optimist, entrepreneur & engineer.

## ðŸ”­ Current projects:
### [Promptme](trypromptme.com)
Created in less than 24 hours at the Anthropic Hackathon in London, we even got third place! We wanted to build a tool to help people evaluate how good they really are at prompting AI's using games. The use of AI is only going to become more and more prevalent so it's important to understand how to interact with it effectively. We plan to launch it on product hunt and hacker news etc soon with a few improvements!

### [Futurejourneys.co](https://futurejourneys.co/)
This is my main gig! Trying to improve the technology onboard buses, starting with an all in one software and hardware solution for audio and visual announcement's on buses across the UK. 

### [FLEXSTA](https://flexsta.com/)
Solving my own problems! Over the last few years I've often found myself working in many inconvenient locations, and I really enjoy having an extra screen to work from, so I got a portable monitor but there weren't any portable monitor stands to go with the displays, so with the power of reddit and my eye for design I came up with several iterations to get to my final solution. I've got it to profitable and now working on improving SEO and content marketing! It's a great example of "solve your own problems" it makes your journey to creating value much easier because you are your own critique, customer and consumer!

## âš¡ Past side projects:
Mostly because they interested me!

### [Listen and Read](https://listenandread.netlify.app/)
I want to be able to listen and read to books at the same time, one book I couldn't find an audio book version for, but I could find an open source text file of the book, so I converted it to audio and created a basic UI to listen and read at the same time. Check it out here - https://listenandread.netlify.app/

### [Publishing.florencehinder.com](Publishing.florencehinder.com) TTS Audio Publishing
I'd been playing around with TTS language models, such as tortoiseTTS and I found it was REALLY good! You can feed in any voice and finetune it on this to produce human realistic audio. It's all trained on audiobooks so I figured, why not try publish and audio book using it. So I choose a short creative commmons licensed book to see if I could publish it on audible. I was curious to find out, would they truly be able to detect it. Turns out they could! Even with making sure I made the quality requirements, etc audible still knew I wasn't legit!

### [The Career Finder](thecareerfinder.app)
I worked with high schools to develop a tool that utilizes job demand data, individual skills, and interests to match students with suitable careers and pathways to consider.
Existing solutions are outdated, inaccurate, and impersonal. Itâ€™s something that Iâ€™d have greatly appreciated when I was at school, instead of having several different career pivots before realizing the technology products with fast paced and adaptive teams were my bread and butter. Understanding users and creating user centric products (whether that's for public transit agencies for fast growing startups).
